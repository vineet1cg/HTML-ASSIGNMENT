    <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is <b>Vineet</b>. I am currently learning HTML       
        <i>from scratch</i> and enjoying every bit of the process.<br>
        I believe that gaining this skill will help me build a strong foundation 
        in web development. I am <mark>curious</mark>, <u>hardworking</u>, and motivated 
        to keep improving myself.

        In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities. I love <i>reading books</i>, 
        playing <u>games</u>, and <mark>exploring new technologies</mark> that inspire me 
        to learn more about programming. Sometimes, I experiment with writing small 
        scripts, and other times I just relax with good music.<br>
        I believe hobbies help maintain a <b>balanced</b> life and spark creativity.

        Looking ahead, one of my big dreams is to become a 
        <b>full-stack developer</b> within the next 2 years.<br>
        I aim to build projects that are both functional and creative, 
        contributing positively to the tech community. Outside my career, 
        I would also like to continue improving myself and help others learn.<br>
        As they say, knowledge is like energy: it can never be wasted, it 
        just transforms (<i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i> as Einstein beautifully put it).
