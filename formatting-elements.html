<h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Early Computers</h2>
<p>
    The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the <abbr title="Abacus">abacus</abbr>. 
    In the 19th century, <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the 
    <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. Ada Lovelace, often regarded as the first programmer, 
    wrote notes that <em>extended</em> its capabilities. The early machines were massive and slow, relying heavily on 
    <mark>manual operations</mark> and <i>early logic circuits</i>. Many of these devices were never fully built, 
    but their conceptual framework <del>laid</del> <ins>sets</ins> the foundation for future computers.
    The <small>mechanical era</small> paved the way for electrical and electronic computing methods.

<h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
<p>
    Over the decades, computers have evolved through distinct generations. The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> 
    was originally based on vacuum tubes, which were large and unreliable. The <mark>first generation</mark> saw these vacuum tubes 
    replaced by <i>transistors</i> in the second generation, providing faster and smaller machines. The third generation 
    introduced <u>integrated circuits</u>, miniaturizing components further. By the <em>fourth generation</em>, microprocessors 
    allowed general-use personal computers to flourish in homes and offices. The terms <strong>hardware</strong> and <kbd>software</kbd> 
    became common as users interacted with machines through interfaces rather than physical switches. A famous equation related 
    to modern physics and computing is Einstein's formula: E = mc<sup>2</sup>.

<h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
<p>
    The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> emerged in the late 20th century, revolutionizing communication. 
    Developed by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, the Web was designed to be universally accessible. As he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <q>
        The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
    </q>
    â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The <em>Internet</em> itself is a complex network connecting millions of <var>nodes</var>. The <code>TCP/IP</code> protocols 
    handled addressing and data transfer. The transition from <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> connections marked the arrival 
    of high-speed, always-on internet access. Technologies like fiber optics and wireless continues to expand accessibility worldwide.

<h2>Modern Era</h2>
<p>
    Today, computers fit in our pockets as <small>smartphones</small>, combining computing power with communication. The Internet supports 
    everything from social media to cloud computing. Devices run software coded in languages like <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Python</code>, 
    and <code>HTML</code>. Modern systems incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate tasks once handled by humans. 
    People use input devices such as keyboards (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>C</kbd>) for commands, and systems respond with messages like 
    <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp> to confirm actions. Chemical formulas are also common examples in technology, like water (H<sub>2</sub>O) 
    or isotopes, e.g., Carbon-14 (C<sub>14</sub>).

<h2>Computer Code Example</h2>
<p>Here is a basic example of HTML code used to display text on a webpage:</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Understanding these formatting tags like <b>bold</b> and <em>emphasis</em> helps web developers create clear and accessible content.
